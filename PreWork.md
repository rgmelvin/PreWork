Prework Module 1: What is Money

Activity: Phone a friend

I asked three people "What is money".

All three agreed that money is an agreed on unit of exchange.
Being from outside of the financial world they were familiar with
the idea of fiat currency but it is not something that they really think
about often. They did, however have an understanding that money is a
a store of value and that the value stored in a unit can change with time.
We talked about cryptocurrency a little. They had little understanding
of the concept of decentralized currency but could understand the
arbitrary nature of assigning value to a representative object.
The concepts of Fungability, Scarcity, and Portablity were obvious to them.
And they felt that these were necessary properties of money.

Activity: Find a set of financial statements

I used EDGAR to look at a few financial statements of companies. One that I
Found interesting was that of Best Buy Co Inc. I looked at their latest 10-Q and
identified the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement.
One interesting line item on the Balance Sheet was titled "Goodwill". 
Otherwise I found the statements to be very straight forward and interesting
to explore. Especially intersting is to understand how much money is 
put back into the company. The operating expenses and how they changed
across the pandemic years was particularly interesting. Also very interesting to 
see how both expenses and earnings changed as we emerged from the grasp of the pandemic.

Prework Module 2: What is Risk?

Activity: Risk Self-Research

Types of risk, main source was Investopedia:

Systematic Risk: The overall market risk. Portfolio diversification cannot mediate
systematic risk because all sectors of the market are affected. Sub-categories of
risk within systematic risk include:
Political risk
Macroeconomic risk
Interest risk
Inflation risk
Liquidity risk
Country risk
Sociopolitical risk.
These all seem to be quite intertwined and I would be interested to see more info
about how these risks relate to each other.

Unsystematic risk: This type of risk refers to risks that are specific to a particular
industry, company, commodity, etc. Diversification of a portfolio can mediate risk in
this category. I am not sure if this type of risk is more or less predictable than
systematic risk but it does seem that more random factors can influence Unsystematic
risk.

Business risk: A probability that a business will succeed.

Country risk: Probability that a country will honour financial contracts.

Credit risk: Probability that a borrower cannot pay the contractual interest or principal.

Foreign Exchange risk: Probability of favorable/ unfavorable currency exchange rates.

Interest Rate risk: Probability of the absolute value of an interest rate being changed.

Political risk: Probability that political instability will affect business.

Counter Party risk: Probability that one party in a transaction will default on
obligations.  I read that this type of risk is associated with broker trading services.

Liquidity Risk:  The probability that a company can access its investments as cash.

I think that contemporary concern centers around Political risk. A war between East
and West is on and political pressures are swaying things to increase financial risk.


Activity: Risk Reflection

I work in scientific research and the types of risk that we consider are very similar to
those that affect the financial world. For example Systematic Risks are embodied by
the number of people who are competing for research funding, the level of funds
that are made available by governments, the ability of a laboratory to sell assets
or produce products that can be traded for cash or funding, and the university
administration's decisions on space allocation, equipment maintenance, and personel
funding. Unsystematic risks in research science include variability in cost of 
reagents and equipment. For example when COVID 19 testing took off we saw a 400%
increase in the cost of laboratory chemicals associated with the testing. Supply 
chain risks are very influential and affect everything from staffing to paying
for time on shared equipment. I think that Business risk is similar to Hypothesis
risk in science. Political risk is always influential in science labs as
government initiatives and types and level of funding change with political appointments.

Activity: Ratio Deep Dive

In addition to the Sharpe, Sortino, and Information ratios, I found:

Debt to Capital Ratio: Comparison of a company's short- and long-term debt with their
total capital. A low debt: capital ratio is preferred.  Calculated as: Debt/ (Debt +
Shareholder's Equity)

Debt to Equity Ratio: Indicates how able a company is to meet its outstanding debt 
obligations. A low debt: Equity ratio is preferred. It is calculated as: Debt/ 
Shareholder Equity.

Interest Coverage Ratio: Indicates the number of times that a company can make
the required annual interest payments on its outstanding debt with current before
tax earnings. The ratio is calculated as: Earnings Before Interest & Taxes/ Interest
Expenses.  A ratio < 1.5 is indicative of a troubled future. When the ratio is very
high there is indication that a company is not taking advantage of its gained
financial leverage.

I found a Degree of Combined Leverage Ratio that estimates the combined effect of both
business risk and financial risk on earnings per share when given a specified
decrease in sales. A high value of this ratio indicates more fixed costs and higher risk
of investment in the company. The ratio is calculated as: %Change in Earnings Per Share/
%Change in Sales.

Prework Module 3: Investing

Activity: Inflation Reflection

Currently I am keeping ahead of inflation. One reason I am ahead is that I change 
positions frequently. Each time I change position my salary is reset to competitive
market rate. It is something that I worry about in keeping a position for long term.
Salary increases are based on merit at US universities. Merit is a combination of 
productivity, service, and politics and missing merit increase for even one year 
would leave you at standard annual increase in salary. Currently most universities offer
1.5% increase in salary as a base rate with up to 8% depending on the number and size
of grant contracts that secured. The mean increase is around 2.5% per year. An average 
academic can maintain this type of increase to within 5 years of retirement. This is 
well ahead of "normal" inflation rates and hedges against the type of inflation that we
are currently seeing. It is the crafty and innovate who keep beyond falling into a 
teaching role who are able to keep ahead. As soon as an academic loses currency and is
forced to teach, they will begin to fall behind... hopefully they had some good years
before that. Nonetheless, a 1.5% increase will generally keep people above the water
line of inflation.... usually.

Activity: Calculating TVM

Investment opportunity A:
$20,000 value after 2 years, compounding semi-annually at 5%
Present Value = 20,000/([1 + (0.05/2)]^2*2) = 18,119
So would make about 940.00 per year or $5.18/ $1 invested.

Investment opportunity B: 
$15,000 value after 1 year, compounding once at 4%
Present Value = 15,000/([1+(0.04/1)]^1*1) = 14,423
So would make about 577.00 per year or $0.04/ $1 invested.

Investment opportunity C:
$18,000 value after 1 year, compounding semi-annually at 8%
Present Value = 18,000/([1+ (0.08/2)]^2*1) = 16,642
So would make about 679.00 per year or $4.08/ 1$ invested.

I think that Investment A values my present cash highest. 
I think that a two year investment is likely to be riskiest.
I would invest in Investment A. Even though it is a greater initial investment
it values my cash higher and returns more.

Activity: Portfolio Comparisons.

Modern Porfolio Theory: The modern porfolio theory aims to balance market volatility
with return by diversifying a portfolio of investments. The theory helps to optmize
investment return for a given tolerance of risk. Where possible it strives to 
find investments that have strong expected returns yet have miss-aligned short-term
outcomes. This seemingly disjoint strategy buffers the portfolio against volatility
in any one sector. A risk vs. return plot can be used to find the "efficient frontier"
investment strategy where the two variables are balanced.

Time Value of Money (TVM): The TVM can help you to determine how much money 
you are willing to spend for a specific monetary outcome. It can help with 
choosing the porfolio that best matches your financial goals.

Sharpe Ratio: The Sharpe ratio compares the average return in excess of the risk-
free rate of return to market volatility. Here market volatility is a backwards-facing
estimation of the standard deviation of asset value. The ratio looks at a portfolio's past
performance to assess the excess risk taken by the investor. One looks for a high Ratio
that indicates small volatility and high return.  
A caveat of the Sharpe Ratio and all of these metrics is that markets are assumed to
follow a normal distribution. I have not read yet where this assumption is rigorously
tested or how data distributions are explored. Additionally, the application of 
frequentist methods, although comforting (like a stiff drink) are questionable since 
markets are subject to human manipulation due to learning. I also do not see any of these
metrics being forward-looking or predictive, nor do they take into account the potential
for market evolution. If you are happy with the thinking that the world has always been
the way it is today and will continue this way forever, then these metrics make perfect
sense. In light of market evolution over time and the way priors are updated frequently, 
I think these methods probably have high error over even the short-term future. Maybe the
lack of statistical sophistication explains the common idea that markets are less
predictable than the weather.
Anyway, a Sharpe ratio > 1.0 is considered to be good. You can always reset your
window size to get the ratio where you want it. I have not seen a method by which
appropriate window size is tested and determined for a specific set of data.

Sortino Ratio: The Sortino Ratio attempts to give the worst case scenario by considering
only the harmful volatility. It calculates the return in excess of the risk-free rate
divided by the standard deviation below the mean asset (portfolio) value.
Hmm... These are all z-scores, essentially, right?
The Sortino Ratio is considered to be a better indicator than the Sharpe Ratio. Higher 
Sortino Ratio indicates that the investment gives a higher rate of return per unit of 
bad risk. Again, this is backward facing and likely has a high degree of error associated
with it.

Information Ratio:  The Information Ratio compares a portfolio so some benchmark standard
like the S&P500. This gauges performance against the broader market. I think this is
a valuable comparison to a control however it is still rear-facing and likely subject
to a high degree of error.

Volatility is simply defined on the standard deviation. I think this a very reasonable
basic metric that assess the amount of risk over a period of time. Of course, as with
all of these, it is backwards looking and dependent on the window of time one is looking
at.... don't like the risk? increase your window size... very manipulable.

The CAPM model. CAPM stands for Capital Asset Pricing Model. The model describes the
interaction between systematic risk and the return that is expected. The model
is a more sophisticated look at how a portfolio performs. It incorporates a term
called beta that is calculated from the Covariance of an individual stock and the market 
divided by the variance of the market. So it is looking at systematic risk and how it 
affects the stock or portfolio under consideration. I think this model nicely incorporates
a metric of market fluctuation into it. Again, it is backwards facing but even though
it is probably prone to high error and manipulation by window size, it likely gives
an answer within 78% around the true mean. Even though I like this metric a little better,
it is frequentist and can't be used to predict an evolving market or to test alternative
market trajectories... I think this anyway. I would be happy to learn more about
modern ways of analyzing portfolios.

Module 5: Startup Survival Guide.

Activity: Crunching Crunchbase.

I just looked at a few of the companies in the "Trending on Crunchbase" list.

On top of the list came Cake Technologies, a company that has 8 employees and has
developed an app that restaurants can use for billing customers... customers can
use to pay restaurant bills.. splitting check, tipping, etc. Cake obtained 1.1 million
pounds of funding through Crowdcube! Fantastic! Crowdcube allows individuals to invest
in companies for some return on the equity. They only had one round of funding and then
were acquired by American Express for 13.3 million pounds. Fantastic! What a story!
